# Intended use of the framework
The app will be divided into a lot of smaller pieces that we assemble in main or in the 'pages' folder .

Different type of pieces are : 
 - Widgets
 - Services 
 - Models

## Widgets
So far, we have : 
 - Bottom_app_bar: 
    - don't like the name, would prefer "Navigation_Bar"
    - Used to navigate between the different pages
    - See theme and colors in the [miro](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVKEYr8RA=/)

 - Floating_menu: 
    - Same, would prefer "Floating_button"
    - Contains the 'add_book'
